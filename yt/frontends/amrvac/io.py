        # Fortran-like input array with the dimension (z,y,x), a matrix

        @Notes from Niels:
        The chunks list has YTDataChunk objects containing the different grids.
        The list of grids can be obtained by doing eg. grids_list = chunks[0].objs or chunks[1].objs etc.
        Every element in "grids_list" is then an AMRVACGrid object, and has hence all attributes of a grid
            (Level, ActiveDimensions, LeftEdge, etc.)
